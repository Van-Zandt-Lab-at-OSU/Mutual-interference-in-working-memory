Folder "aging" contains Rstan data and model for Section 3.1: application to the Oberauer & Kliegl (2001) data set.
Folder "training" contains Rstan data and model for Section 3.2: application to the de Simone & Von Bastian (2018) data set.
Folder "simulation" contains data and code for simulations.
We did not upload the modeling results due to their sizes. All modeling results can be obtained by running the models using seeds indicated in the files.
Please notice that data included in this project are for demonstration purposes. The full data sets belong to Dr. Oberauer and Dr. Von Bastian's teams.
